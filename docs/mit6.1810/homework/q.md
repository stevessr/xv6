# Homework: question

In a file named `question.txt`,
write a question about the assigned reading/topic
(e.g., what you found most confusing).

Before lecture (1pm), submit the file directly (not in a zip)
to the corresponding "Lecture *" assignment on Gradescope.
To the extent possible, during lecture we will
try to answer questions submitted the evening before.
