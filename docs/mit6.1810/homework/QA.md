# Homework: Q&A session

In a file named `question.txt`, write a question about one of the previous labs (i.e., one you already submitted). For example, something you wondered about while doing the lab, something you didn't understand, or just anything.

Before lecture (1pm), submit the file directly (not in a zip) to the corresponding "Lecture *" assignment on Gradescope. To the extent possible, during lecture we will try to answer questions submitted the evening before. In lecture we will also discuss our solutions.
