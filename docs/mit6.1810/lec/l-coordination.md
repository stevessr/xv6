# LEC 12: Coordination

These lecture notes are intended for class discussion and reference code.

Main code: [`kernel/pipe.c`](/source/xv6-riscv/kernel/pipe.c)

Notes: The course schedule (`schedule.md`) lists LEC 12 as "Coordination" and references the kernel example implementation `pipe.c`. This page acts as a placeholder to make sidebar links work and to point directly at the source for reading.
