# LEC 4: Processes

This page is a placeholder that points to the course notes used as the canonical source.

- Primary reference: /2024/lec/l-os.txt (Processes and OS internals)
- Supplement: /2024/lec/l-overview.txt (introductory examples: fork, exec)

If you want this page converted to standalone Markdown, I can import and format the relevant sections from the 2024 notes (fork/exec, process lifecycle, pid, scheduling examples).
