# LEC 3: xv6 + Tools

This lecture is covered by the course "Tools" page under the 2024 site.

See the full tools/setup guide (installing QEMU, RISC-V toolchain, GDB, etc.):

- /2024/labs/tools.html

If you want this page to contain the full notes instead of linking, I can
copy or convert the `2024/labs/tools.html` content into Markdown here; tell me if
you prefer that.
