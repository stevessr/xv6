LEC 5: User-level virtual memory

This is a placeholder lecture page to fix 404s caused by sidebar links (ordered by course schedule).

References:

- [Virtual memory for applications — Lecture notes (2024)](/2024/lec/l-uservm.txt)
- [uservm-faq.txt — FAQ (2024)](/mit6.1810/homework/uservm-faq.md)
- mmap.c — example code (sqrt example) (see /mit6.1810/homework/mmap.c)
- [Homework / exercises page](/mit6.1810/homework/l-uservm.md)

If desired, I can convert the 2024 content into a full Markdown lecture and replace this placeholder page.
