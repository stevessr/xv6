# Lab: file system

In this lab you will add large files and symbolic links to the xv6
  file system.

> Before writing code, you should read "Chapter 8:
>   File system" from the [xv6
>   book](/assets/mit6.1810/book-riscv-rev4.pdf) and study the corresponding code.

Fetch the xv6 source for the lab and check out the `util` branch:

```
  $ git fetch
  $ git checkout fs
  $ make clean
```

## Large files

In this assignment you'll increase the maximum size of an xv6
file. Currently xv6 files are limited to 268 blocks, or 268*BSIZE
bytes (BSIZE is 1024 in xv6). This limit comes from the fact that an
xv6 inode contains 12 "direct" block numbers and one "singly-indirect"
block number, which refers to a block that holds up to 256 more block
  numbers, for a total of 12+256=268 blocks.

The [`bigfile`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#bigfile-user-usertests-c) command creates the longest file it can,
and reports that size:
```
$ bigfile
..
wrote 268 blocks
bigfile: file is too small
$
```
The test fails because [`bigfile`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#bigfile-user-usertests-c) expects to be able
to create a file with 65803 blocks, but unmodified xv6 limits
files to 268 blocks.

You'll change the xv6 file system code to support a
"doubly-indirect" block in each inode, containing 256 addresses of
singly-indirect blocks, each of which can contain up to 256 addresses
of data blocks. The result will be that a file will be able to consist
of up to 65803 blocks, or 256*256+256+11 blocks (11 instead of 12, because we will
sacrifice one of the direct block numbers for the double-indirect
block).

### Preliminaries

The `mkfs` program creates the xv6 file system disk image
and determines
how many total blocks the file system has; this size is controlled by
`FSSIZE` in `kernel/param.h`.
You'll see that `FSSIZE` in the repository for
this lab is set to
200,000 blocks.  You should see the following output from `mkfs/mkfs`
in the make output:
```
nmeta 70 (boot, super, log blocks 30 inode blocks 13, bitmap blocks 25) blocks 199930 total 200000
```
This line describes the file system that `mkfs/mkfs` built: it
has 70 meta-data blocks (blocks used to describe the file system) and
199,930 data blocks, totaling 200,000 blocks.

Note that `make qemu` builds a new `fs.img`, and
saves the old one in `fs.img.bk`. If you want to run xv6 with
the existing `fs.img` instead of building a new one,
run `make qemu-fs`.

### What to Look At

The format of an on-disk inode is defined by `struct dinode`
in `fs.h`. You're particularly interested in `NDIRECT`,
`NINDIRECT`, `MAXFILE`, and the `addrs[]` element
of `struct dinode`. Look at Figure 8.3 in the xv6 text for a
diagram of the standard xv6 inode.

The code that finds a file's data on disk is in `bmap()`
in `fs.c`. Have a look at it and make sure you understand
what it's doing. `bmap()` is called both when reading and
writing a file. When writing, `bmap()` allocates new
blocks as needed to hold file content, as well as allocating
an indirect block if needed to hold block addresses.

`bmap()` deals with two kinds of block numbers. The `bn`
argument is a "logical block number" -- a block number within the file,
relative to the start
of the file. The block numbers in `ip->addrs[]`, and the
argument to [`bread()`](/source/xv6-riscv/kernel/bio.c.md#bread-kernel-bio-c), are disk block numbers.
You can view `bmap()` as mapping a file's logical
block numbers into disk block numbers.

### Your Job

> Modify `bmap()` so that it implements a doubly-indirect block,
> in addition to direct blocks and a singly-indirect block.  You'll have
> to have only 11 direct blocks, rather than 12, to make room for your
> new doubly-indirect block; you're not allowed to change the size of an
> on-disk inode.  The first 11 elements of `ip->addrs[]` should
> be direct blocks; the 12th should be a singly-indirect block (just
> like the current one); the 13th should be your new doubly-indirect
> block. You are done with this exercise when [`bigfile`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#bigfile-user-usertests-c) writes
> 65803 blocks and `usertests -q` runs successfully:

```
$ bigfile
..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
wrote 65803 blocks
done; ok
$ usertests -q
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ 
```

[`bigfile`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#bigfile-user-usertests-c) will take at least a minute and a half to run.

Hints:

*   Make sure you understand `bmap()`. Write out a diagram of the
    relationships between `ip->addrs[]`, the indirect block, the
    doubly-indirect block and the singly-indirect blocks it points to, and
    data blocks. Make sure you understand why adding a doubly-indirect
    block increases the maximum file size by 256*256 blocks (really -1,
    since you have to decrease the number of direct blocks by one).

*   Think about how you'll index the doubly-indirect block, and
    the indirect blocks it points to, with the logical block
    number.

*   If you change the definition of `NDIRECT`, you'll
    probably have to change the declaration of `addrs[]`
    in `struct inode` in `file.h`. Make sure that
    `struct inode` and `struct dinode` have the
    same number of elements in their `addrs[]` arrays.

*   If you change the definition of `NDIRECT`, make sure to create a
    new `fs.img`, since `mkfs` uses `NDIRECT` to build the
    file system.  

*   If your file system gets into a bad state, perhaps by crashing,
    delete `fs.img` (do this from Unix, not xv6).  `make` will build a
    new clean file system image for you.

*   Don't forget to [`brelse()`](/source/xv6-riscv/kernel/bio.c.md#brelse-kernel-bio-c) each block that you
    [`bread()`](/source/xv6-riscv/kernel/bio.c.md#bread-kernel-bio-c).

*   You should allocate indirect blocks and doubly-indirect
    blocks only as needed, like the original `bmap()`.

*   Make sure `itrunc` frees all blocks of a file, including
    double-indirect blocks.

*   `usertests` takes longer to run than in previous labs
    because for this lab `FSSIZE` is larger and big files are
    larger.

## Symbolic links

In this exercise you will add symbolic links to xv6.  Symbolic
links (or soft links) refer to a linked file or directory
by pathname; when a
symbolic link is opened, the kernel looks up the linked-to name.
Symbolic links resemble hard links, but hard links are
restricted to pointing to files on the same disk,
cannot refer to directories,
and are tied to a specific target i-node rather than (as with
symbolic links) referring to whatever happens at the moment
to be at the target name, if anything.
Implementing this system call is a good exercise to
understand how pathname lookup works.

You do not have to handle symbolic links to directories for this
lab; the only system call that needs to know how to follow
symbolic links is [`open()`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#open-user-usertests-c).

### Your job

> You will implement the `symlink(char *target, char *path)`
> system call, which creates a new symbolic link at path that refers
> to file named by target. For further information, see the man page
> symlink.  To test, add symlinktest to the Makefile and run it. Your
> solution is complete when the tests produce the following output
> (including usertests succeeding).

```
$ symlinktest
Start: test symlinks
test symlinks: ok
Start: test concurrent symlinks
test concurrent symlinks: ok
$ usertests -q
...
ALL TESTS PASSED
$ 
```
 
Hints:

*   First, create a new system call number for symlink, add an entry
    to user/usys.pl, user/user.h, and implement an empty sys_symlink in kernel/sysfile.c.

*   Add a new file type (`T_SYMLINK`) to kernel/stat.h to
    represent a symbolic link.

*   Add a new flag to kernel/fcntl.h, (`O_NOFOLLOW`), that can
    be used with the [`open`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#open-user-usertests-c) system call. Note that flags passed to
    [`open`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#open-user-usertests-c) are combined using a bitwise OR operator, so your new
    flag should not overlap with any existing flags. This will let you
    compile user/symlinktest.c once you add it to the Makefile.

*   Implement the `symlink(target, path)` system call to create
    a new symbolic link at path that refers to target. Note that target
    does not need to exist for the system call to succeed. You will need
    to choose somewhere to store the target path of a symbolic link, for
    example, in the inode's data blocks. `symlink` should return an integer
    representing success (0) or failure (-1) similar to `link` and `unlink`.

*   Modify the [`open`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#open-user-usertests-c) system call to handle the case where the path
    refers to a symbolic link. If the file does not exist, [`open`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#open-user-usertests-c)
    must fail.  When a process specifies `O_NOFOLLOW` in the flags
    to [`open`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#open-user-usertests-c), [`open`](/source/xv6-riscv/user/usertests.c.md#open-user-usertests-c) should open the symlink (and not
    follow the symbolic link).

*   If the linked file is also a symbolic link, you must recursively
    follow it until a non-link file is reached. If the links form a cycle,
    you must return an error code. You may approximate this by returning
    an error code if the depth of links reaches some threshold (e.g., 10).

*   Other system calls (e.g., link and unlink) must not
    follow symbolic links; these system calls operate on the symbolic
    link itself.

## Submit the lab

### Time spent

Create a new file, `time.txt`, and put in a single integer, the
number of hours you spent on the lab.
`git add` and `git commit` the file.

### Answers

If this lab had questions, write up your answers in `answers-*.txt`.
`git add` and `git commit` these files.

### Submit

Assignment submissions are handled by Gradescope.
You will need an MIT gradescope account.
See Piazza for the entry code to join the class.
Use [this link](https://help.gradescope.com/article/gi7gm49peg-student-add-course#joining_a_course_using_a_course_code)
if you need more help joining.

When you're ready to submit, run `make zipball`,
which will generate `lab.zip`.
Upload this zip file to the corresponding Gradescope assignment.

If you run `make zipball` and you have either uncomitted changes or
untracked files, you will see output similar to the following:
```
 M hello.c
?? bar.c
?? foo.pyc
Untracked files will not be handed in.  Continue? [y/N]
```
Inspect the above lines and make sure all files that your lab solution needs
are tracked, i.e., not listed in a line that begins with `??`.
You can cause `git` to track a new file that you create using
`git add {filename}`.

> **Warning**
> *   Please run `make grade` to ensure that your code passes all of the tests.
