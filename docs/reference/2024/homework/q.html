<h1>Homework: question</h1>

<p>
In a file named <tt>question.txt</tt>,
write a question about the assigned reading/topic
(e.g., what you found most confusing).

<p>
Before lecture (1pm), submit the file directly (not in a zip)
to the corresponding "Lecture *" assignment on Gradescope.
To the extent possible, during lecture we will
try to answer questions submitted the evening before.
