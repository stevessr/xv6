<h1>Homework: Q&A session</h1>

<p>
In a file named <tt>question.txt</tt>,
write a question about one of the previous labs
(i.e., one you already submitted).
For example, something you wondered about while doing the lab,
something you didn't understand, or just anything.

<p>
Before lecture (1pm), submit the file directly (not in a zip)
to the corresponding "Lecture *" assignment on Gradescope.
To the extent possible, during lecture we will
try to answer questions submitted the evening before.
In lecture we will also discuss our solutions.
